I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special.

I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids.\", 'review_rating': '2', 'type_of_traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'seat_type': 'Economy Class', 'route': 'London to Hong Kong', 'date_flown': 'January 2024', 'inflight_entertainment': 1}]\n"
